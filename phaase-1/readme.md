📌 Project Overview

The Final-SQL-Project-WHO is a structured SQL database project inspired by the World Health Organization (WHO).
It demonstrates the design, implementation, and management of healthcare datasets, covering patient records, hospitals, staff, diseases, resources, and global health data.
The project emphasizes schema design, normalization, advanced SQL queries, optimization, and analytical reporting to support healthcare decision-making at scale.

🎯 Objectives

Design a relational database schema for healthcare data management.

Apply normalization to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Write complex SQL queries including joins, subqueries, CTEs, views, and stored procedures.

Implement transaction control for reliable and consistent operations.

Perform data analysis and reporting to support healthcare insights.

Showcase real-world problem-solving aligned with WHO goals.
