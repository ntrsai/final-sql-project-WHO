ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Final-SQL-Project-WHO is a comprehensive SQL-based database project inspired by the World Health Organization (WHO).
It focuses on designing and managing databases for global healthcare datasets, including patient records, healthcare staff, hospitals, diseases, and resource allocation.
This project highlights schema design, normalization, advanced SQL queries, and analytical reporting to demonstrate effective data-driven decision-making in the healthcare sector.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Build a structured relational database schema for healthcare data.

Apply normalization techniques to ensure efficiency and consistency.

Implement complex SQL queries such as joins, subqueries, views, and stored procedures.

Use data analysis and reporting for healthcare insights (patients, hospitals, diseases).

Showcase real-world healthcare problem solving with SQL.
